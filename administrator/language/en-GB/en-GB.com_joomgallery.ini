Further information you will find <a href="http://www.cooliris.com/">here</a>. If the function is set to "yes" a small symbol is shown at the lower left of the thumbnail when moving the cursor over it. A click on it opens the Cooliris Gallery. At page by page design in the JoomGallery in the Cooliris Gallery the images will be loaded page after page dynamically by moving sidewards.
JGA_CONFIG_GS_AF_ITEMID=Default Itemid
JGA_CONFIG_GS_AF_ITEMID_LONG=Here you may specify an Itemid (which controls the highlighted menu item while viewing a page) that will be used in JoomGallery and its extensions <b>whenever no proper Itemid was found for a view</b>. Some extensions of JoomGallery may override this setting by using its own parameters. If you don't specify an Itemid here the database will be searched for a menu item associated with JoomGallery in order to use that Itemid. Please note: The Itemid set here or in the extensions <b>has to be</b> an existing one. To select an Itemid, please have a look at the last column in the menu item manager for each of your menus.

JGA_CONFIG_GS_BU_DELETE_ORIGINAL_CHECKBOX=Dialog box
JGA_CONFIG_GS_BU_DELETE_ORIGINAL_LONG=This option enables you to delete the original image from the corresponding folder right after the upload. This is an interesting feature in case you have little server space and you do not depend on the popup function (popups are no longer displayed after the original file is deleted). If you choose the dialog box you will be asked every time you upload images in the backend whether or not to delete the original images.
JGA_CONFIG_GS_BU_DESCENDING=descending
JGA_CONFIG_GS_BU_FILENAMENUMBER=Numbering
JGA_CONFIG_GS_BU_FILENAMENUMBER_LONG=Should the uploaded images be numbered consecutively?

JGA_CONFIG_GS_BU_UPLOAD_ORDER=Ordering numbers
JGA_CONFIG_GS_BU_UPLOAD_ORDER_LONG=Do you want to assign ordering numbers to the images automatically? Which ordering sequence do you prefer? Ordering numbers are an important tool to control the arrangement of images in the frontend. Ordering numbers are stored in the data base and can be edited in the image manager later on. Automatically assigning ordering numbers while uploading will make the arrangement of the image in the frontend and the administrative management in the backend easier. Generally you should choose an ascending order. (This setting also applies to the frontend user upload.
JGA_CONFIG_GS_BU_WRONG_VALUE_COLOR=Background color for wrong entries
JGA_CONFIG_GS_BU_WRONG_VALUE_COLOR_LONG=The background of input boxes in the upload section containing a wrong or insufficient entry will be colored in the HEX value or color name you specify here.<br />Please leave the field empty if you do not want to change the color.
JGA_CONFIG_GS_IP_DIRECTION_RESIZE=Thumbnail conversion
JGA_CONFIG_GS_IP_DIRECTION_RESIZE_LONG=The purpose of the thumbnail conversion is to display all thumbnails in either the same width or height without reference to the original image format (portrait or landscape). Choosing "by height" for example will generate thumbnails of the same height provided that the width is adequate. Entering equal values in the two options below in order to generate thumbnails with untouched aspect ratio will void the value entered here.
JGA_CONFIG_GS_IP_FAST_GD2_THUMBCREATION=Faster downsizing of images
JGA_CONFIG_GS_IP_FAST_GD2_THUMBCREATION_LONG=If image processor "GD2 Library" is chosen it is possible to define that for creation of thumbnails and optionally downsizing images an optimized function for the upload process shall be used. This function allows a much faster downsizing and therefore a shorter runtime of the upload script but is in need of four times bigger memory than the slower pendant. If there is only few memory available this option should not be chosen.
JGA_CONFIG_GS_IP_GD2LIB=GD2 Library
JGA_CONFIG_GS_IP_GDLIB=GD Library
JGA_CONFIG_GS_IP_GDLIB_INSTALLED=It appears that GD is installed and working properly.  Your system seems to have GD version %s. Thumbnails and resizing should work correctly.
JGA_CONFIG_GS_IP_GDLIB_NOT_INSTALLED=GD does not seem to be installed on your system. JoomGallery requires GD in order to create thumbnails or resize your images.  Without GD you will have to manually create your thumbnails and upload them individually. If you do not intend to use GD, then set GD to None. If you need help installing GD, refer to %s for more information.
JGA_CONFIG_GS_IP_GDLIB_NO_VERSION=GD appears to be installed, but we can not verify the version. Check the HELP » SYSTEM INFO » PHP INFORMATION screen to verify your GD installation and version.
JGA_CONFIG_GS_IP_IMAGEMAGICK=ImageMagick
JGA_CONFIG_GS_IP_IMAGE_CREATOR=Image processor
JGA_CONFIG_GS_IP_IMAGE_CREATOR_LONG=Choose the software for image processing. The software should already be installed on the server and is required for manipulating images such as resizing or adding a watermark to them. Most servers run a PHP version that already has the GD2 implemented. The GD version installed on your system is displayed in the line above this paragraph. If only the GD-Software is present you should always prefer GD2 because otherwise you will miss several manipulating functions. If ImageMagick is installed you should always prefer that software, because the results will be much more better.
JGA_CONFIG_GS_IP_IMAGE_QUALITY=Quality
JGA_CONFIG_GS_IP_IMAGE_QUALITY_LONG=Quality of the image after resizing. This option works only if the resizing (two options above) is activated. The entered value (percent) specifies the quality of the generated downsized images - in relation to the original image. Mind that higher quality will require more server space.
